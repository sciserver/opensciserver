# opensciserver

SciServer is a collaborative environment for server-side analysis with extremely
large datasets. The flagship installation is hosted at JHU at
https://apps.sciserver.org/ - this repository contains the software that powers
that system (and others), so you can install and start working with your
datasets!

For more information about the background of SciServer, see ‚ÄúSciServer: a
Science Platform for Astronomy and Beyond‚Äù (Taghizadeh-Popp et al., 2020,
arXiv:2001.08619). If you use SciServer in your work, please cite that paper.

üöß‚ùó While SciServer is a mature software system, we are in the process of
setting up the open repository for it here. Please feel free to create issues
and/or pull requests, but note that our capacity and guidance on resolving those
will be limited until we complete activities related to setting this repository
up! ‚ùóüöß

## Installation

The SciServer system comprises of several distinct components that communicate
with each-other over HTTP, we support installation on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) via [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

Prerequisites:
* A kubernetes cluster with an ingress controller
* A domain name that points to the ingress controller, and SSL certificates
* helm installed

Mainline commits, pull-requests and tagged versions have built artifacts
available on the github container registry with tags matching the version. Helm
charts are likewise published for each of the above to a github pages site at

https://sciserver.github.io/opensciserver/sciserver-{version}.tar.gz

where `{version}` is either a semver version (such as `1.0.0`) for release
installs or `pr-{pr-number}` where `{pr-number}` is the pull request number
(this is indicated in the title of the PR).

### Demo installations

For a demonstration installation with limited dependencies and no persistent
data, we can install as follows, noting that we are supplying a set of example
passwords for services that need them:

```sh
helm -n {namespace} \
  {name} \
  upgrade --install \
  --set prefix={name} \
  --set baseDomain={domain-name} \
  --set backup.enable=false \
  --set logging.api.replicaCount=0 \
  --set proxy.cidrWhiteList=0.0.0.0/0 \
  --set dev.nopvc=true \
  -f https://sciserver.github.io/opensciserver/helm/sciserver/password-manifest.yaml \
  https://sciserver.github.io/opensciserver/sciserver-{version}.tar.gz
```

replace `{namespace}`, `{name}` and `{domain-name}` Some options above (such as
the logging api replica count) are there due to incompleteness of this repo, or
needs fixing. Once this is installed, the dashboard will be available at
`https://{domain-name}/{name}`!

### From a local build of the charts

If you need to modify the charts or want to build them locally for any reason,
follow the below instructions.

First checkout the repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/sciserver/opensciserver.git
# or for ssh
# git clone git@github.com:sciserver/opensciserver.git
cd opensciserver
```

Then build the helm charts, supplying the image repository location and version
tag. For official and pr builds, this will be github container registry at the
address indicated:

```sh
# within this repo
make helm REPO=ghcr.io/sciserver/opensciserver VTAG=main
```

The above will build the helm chart where images are located in the official
github container registry for opensciserver and we want those built from the
latest commit to main. This will place the zipped chart under
`helm/build/sciserver-{VTAG}.tar.gz`, which can be directly specified to helm as
the chart source (see below). To reference a pull request, simply replace `VTAG`
as appropriate (`pr-` plus the pull request number):

```sh
make helm REPO=ghcr.io/sciserver/opensciserver VTAG=pr-6
```

Once the charts are built, we can install using helm as above, replacing the
chart URL with the path the the locally built chart.

### Production installations

## Building

We coordinate the multi-component builds with a make file at root, which
contains commands for building individual components and the system as a whole.
The github ci action demonstrates what is needed to make a complete build and
upload artifacts, briefly:

```sh
# make the java components
make java

# make all images and their dependencies. The default naming scheme is
# sciserver/component:version where the version is related to the git commit at
# HEAD.
make images
# explicitly set a tag
make images VTAG={tag}

# make documentation
make docs
```

And so on.
