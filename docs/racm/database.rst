RACM Database
=============

The database is derived from the UML model described in the :ref:`racm_datamodel` documentation.
In the past we used an automated pipeline to derive alternate "representations" of the UML data model, in particular Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts
to create tables and views in a relational database.
