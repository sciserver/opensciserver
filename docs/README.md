## Build documentation

Building docs requires Python. From this directory, install the required packages into your python
environment using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then build html documentation:

```
make html
```

The documents will be under _build/html where you can browse generated documents from the index page
included there.

For more information on building using sphinx, see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html.
